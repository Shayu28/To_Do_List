###Project Title: Interactive To-Do List Web Application

### Introduction

The **Interactive To-Do List Web Application** is a simple yet powerful tool designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. This web application offers an intuitive interface for creating, tracking, and organizing daily tasks. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the application provides an engaging user experience that encourages productivity and effective time management.
